### Preview
Hereâ€™s a preview of what the file displays:

#### Code Snippet Example
```python
class RoomSimulation:
    def __init__(self, room_name):
        self.room_name = room_name
        self.temperature = 22
        self.lighting = "bright"

    def update_temperature(self, delta):
        self.temperature += delta
        self.temperature = max(10, min(self.temperature, 30))

    def toggle_lighting(self):
        self.lighting = "dim" if self.lighting == "bright" else "bright"

    def get_state(self):
        return {
            "room_name": self.room_name,
            "temperature": self.temperature,
            "lighting": self.lighting
        }
```

#### Simulation Output Example
```json
{
    "room_name": "Gyoshi's Living Room",
    "temperature": 25,
    "lighting": "dim"
}
```
